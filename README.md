Odin Project's 3rd Activity: Etch-a-sketch made in jQuery.

This are the 5 features in my work:
1. Default etch-a-sketch: Done. The current limit of columns is at 113.<br>
2. Changing Colors: Done and no bugs! Yay! <br>
3. Opacity: Done and no bugs! Yay! <br>
4. Trailing: Done and no bugs! Yay! <br>
5. Trailing w/ Colors: The trail is still in white. Will fix this later. <br>
